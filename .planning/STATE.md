# STATE: STREAM.jl

*Project memory — updated at the start and end of every session*

---

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-17)

**Core value:** A Julia MTK-based thermal-hydraulics library that matches Python STREAM results, proving the architecture is sound before large-scale porting begins.
**Current focus:** Phase 20 — Sign Safety (v0.6 start)
**Python STREAM reference:** ~/projects/STREAM

---

## Current Position

Phase: 20 of 24 (Sign Safety)
Plan: 02 complete (phase 20 complete)
Status: Phase complete
Last activity: 2026-03-17 — 20-02 sign safety tests and abs(mdot) energy balance fix complete

Progress: [██████████] 100% (2 of 2 phase 20 plans complete)

| Phase 20 P02 | 100 | 2 tasks | 4 files |

## Accumulated Context

### Key Decisions (carry-forward for v0.6)

- [v0.5]: solve_transient is now keyword-only — SOLV-01 must preserve this convention when adding `callbacks` kwarg
- [v0.4]: ifelse() used for flow reversal and regime switching — SIGN-01..03 may need to audit all ifelse() sign usages
- [v0.4]: Correlation functions are plain Julia closures (not @register_symbolic) — elenbaas_nusselt follows the same pattern
- [v0.4]: Re/Nu/velocity/Pe are @observed (not unknowns) — SIGN-02 must ensure these stay @observed and sign-correct
- [v0.3]: Flapper is a new component file — goes to src/components/ per CLAUDE.md layout
- [v0.6 SIGN]: ifelse(port_in.mdot >= 0, T_up_fwd, T_up_rev) per-cell upwinding — T_inlet_fwd/rev declared before loop, selection inside loop
- [v0.6 SIGN]: port_in.T ~ T[1] is correct MTK outflow equation (T[1] is outflow temp through port_in under reverse flow)
- [v0.6 SIGN]: velocity[i] (unsigned speed) and v[i] (signed) are distinct observables in ChannelAndContacts
- [v0.6 SIGN-02]: abs(port_in.mdot) in FV energy balance — T_up already selects correct direction; advective flux = |mdot|*cp*(T_up-T[i]); signed mdot gives wrong sign for reversed flow
- [v0.6 SIGN-02]: Q_advect for reversed flow uses T_boundary_inlet (from port_in.T pin), NOT T[n] (already heated above T_inlet by wall)

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

- VAL-01 (Fourier series validation) is a pre-existing flaky numerical test — not caused by v0.6 changes.
- PUMP-01 requires @register_symbolic for a callable — implementation strategy (wrapping f(t) as symbolic) needs prototyping in plan.
